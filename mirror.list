### Global settings
## These settings should be located before all other settings/options.
## Global settings are using format `set SETTING VALUE`

## Paths to working directories
set base_path         /var/spool/apt-mirror
## All mirrors will be saved to mirror_path
set mirror_path       $base_path/mirror
## Initial metadata synchronization path
set skel_path         $base_path/skel
## Path to variable data
set var_path          $base_path/var

## Path to apt_auth.conf. See `man apt_auth.conf`
# set etc_netrc         /etc/apt/auth.conf

## Path to default keyring.
## This path is deprecated in the apt and will be removed.
# set etc_trusted       /etc/apt/trusted.gpg

## File fragments for the trusted keys, additional keyrings can be stored here
## (by other packages or the administrator)
# set etc_trusted_parts /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d

## Set to `on` to append to logs instead of truncating them
# set append_logs       off

## Used when architecture is not explicitly specified for a repository.
## Defaults to the host architecture on Debian systems and to amd64 on non-Debian systems.
# set defaultarch       amd64

## Maximum number of simultaneously processed mirrors and simultaneously downloaded files.
## E.g., with nthreads=4, no more than 4 mirrors will be processed and 4 downloads
## across all mirrors will occur simultaneously.
## Since apt-mirror2 does not use threads/processes but is a fully asynchronous program,
## there is usually no need to set this number higher than 8. Moreover, setting it too high may
## break HTTP/2 downloads due to HTTP/2 concurrent stream limits, which are auto-negotiated
## between client and server and (as of now) cannot be limited by the h2 client.
set nthreads          8

## Whether to check release files GPG signature.
## Defaults to `off` to match apt-mirror behavior.
## You could enforce GPG signature verification per server using `gpg_verify url [enable|disable|force]`.
set gpg_verify        off

## Rate limit in bytes per second. Suffixes `k` and `m` are allowed. Not enabled by default.
## You should never set this lower than `slow_rate`.
# set limit_rate        1k

## Enable slow download rate protection. Default: `on`.
# set slow_rate_protection on
## The period (in seconds) during which slow download rate protection will not be applied
## to each individual downloaded file.
# set slow_rate_startup  15
## Slow download protection threshold.
# set slow_rate          100k

set _tilde            0

## Use uvloop if available
# set uvloop            1

## Proxy configuration.
## Only supported for HTTP repositories.
# set use_proxy             off
## If the proxy scheme is omitted, `http://` is assumed.
# set http_proxy            127.0.0.1:3128
# set https_proxy           127.0.0.1:3128
# set proxy_user            user
# set proxy_password        password

## User-Agent for HTTP repositories. Default: `apt-mirror2/VERSION`
# set http_user_agent       apt-mirror2

## Certificates configuration
## Whether to verify HTTPS certificates
# set no_check_certificate  off
## Path to custom CA certificates bundle
# set ca_certificate        /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
## Paths to client certificate and private key for HTTP client authentication
# set certificate           /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt
# set private_key           /etc/ssl/certs/key.pem

## Whether to write file lists (ALL, NEW, MD5, SHA256, SHA512 files) as apt-mirror does.
## Default: off, as apt-mirror2 does not utilize them.
# set write_file_lists        off

## Enable Prometheus client
# set prometheus_enable   off
# set prometheus_host     localhost
# set prometheus_port     8000

## Retries
## How many times to retry downloading broken release files
# set release_files_retries 15

## Run a script after the mirror process completes
# set run_postmirror    0
## Path to post-mirror script
## All configuration variables are available in the script, uppercased
## with the prefix `APT_MIRROR_`, e.g., `${APT_MIRROR_BASE_PATH}`
# set postmirror_script $var_path/postmirror.sh

## By default, redundant files are not removed after a mirror update.
## A shell script is created at the path specified by the `cleanscript` option,
## which can be used to clean the mirror.
# set cleanscript     $var_path/clean.sh

## If the `_autoclean` option is specified and enabled, the clean script will
## not be created, and the mirror will be cleaned automatically.
# set _autoclean 0
## To protect repositories from accidental wiping, do not perform cleanup
## if more than `repository_size * wipe_size_ratio` of total size is to be removed, or
## more than `repository_files_count * wipe_count_ratio` of total files.
## Use 0 to disable wipe protection.
# set wipe_size_ratio 0.4
# set wipe_count_ratio 0.4


### Mirror source settings

## Mirrors are configured using standard sources.list syntax
## Binary mirrors
# deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Or via `deb-arch`
# deb-amd64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-arm64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Although not supported by sources.list, it’s possible to specify codenames or directories
## separated by commas without spaces here.
# deb-amd64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic,jammy main restricted universe multiverse
# deb https://packages.ntop.org/apt-stable/20.04/ x64/,all/

## The `by-hash` option can be used to control mirroring using hashsums paths.
## A `yes` or `no` value activates/disables the use of this feature if this source indicates support for it,
## while `force` will enable the feature regardless of what the source indicates.
## Default: `yes`.
# deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 by-hash=no ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Source mirrors
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-security main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-updates main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-backports main restricted universe multiverse

## Use the special `src` value in the `arch` option to specify a source repository
# deb [ arch=src ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## The `signed-by` is an option to require a repository to pass apt-secure(8) verification with a
## certain set of keys rather than all trusted keys apt has configured.
## See `sources.list(5)` man page for more details.
# deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/some/path/to/keyring.gpg ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

### Per-mirror options
## Per-mirror options using format `option URL values...`

## By default, the name of the mirrored folder is derived from the mirror URL.
## Use `mirror_path` to override the mirror folder name.
# mirror_path http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ubuntu

## The `gpg_verify` option can be used to control release files signature verification.
## Allowed values are `on`, `off`, `force`.
## Defaults to the value of the `gpg_verify` global setting and can be set to `force`, which will make
## apt-mirror2 fail if a GPG signature cannot be found or verified.
# gpg_verify http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu off

## Ignore errors for a specified repository path.
## Can be an exact file or folder.
# ignore_errors https://packages.gitlab.com/runner/gitlab-runner/debian pool/bullseye/main/g/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner_14.8.1_amd64.deb
