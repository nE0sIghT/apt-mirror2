## Paths to working directories
set base_path         /var/spool/apt-mirror
## All mirrors will be saved to mirror_path
set mirror_path       $base_path/mirror
## Initial metadata synchronization path
set skel_path         $base_path/skel

# set append_logs       off

## Used when arch is not explicitly specified for repository.
## Default to host arch for Debian systems and amd64 for non-Debian.
# set defaultarch       amd64

## Maximum number of simultaneously processed mirrors and simultaneously downloaded files.
## Eg with nthreads=4 there are may not be more than 4 mirrors processed and 4 downloads
## for all mirrors simultaneously.
## Because apt-mirror2 don't uses threads/processes but completely asynchronouse program
## there is usualy no need to set this number more than 8. Moreover too high number may
## break http2 downloads due to http2 concurrent streams limits which auto-negotiated by
## client and server and (as of now) can not be limited by the h2 client.
set nthreads          8

## Rate limit in bytes per second. Suffixes `k` and `m` are allowed. Do not enabled by default.
## You should never set it lower than `slow_rate`.
# set limit_rate        1k

## Enable slow download rate protection. Default `on`.
# set slow_rate_protection on
## The period in seconds during which slow download protection will not be applied
## to each individual downloaded file.
# set slow_rate_startup  15
## Slow download protection threshold.
# set slow_rate          100k

set _tilde            0

## Use uvloop if available
# set uvloop            1

## Proxy configuration.
## Only supported for http repositories.
# set use_proxy             off
## If proxy scheme is ommited, `http://` assumed
# set http_proxy            127.0.0.1:3128
# set https_proxy           127.0.0.1:3128
# set proxy_user            user
# set proxy_password        password

## User agent for http repositories. Default `apt-mirror2/VERSION`
# set http_user_agent       apt-mirror2

## Certificates configuration
## Whether to verify https certificate
# set no_check_certificate  off
## Path to custom CA certificates bundle
# set ca_certificate        /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
## Paths to client certificate and private key for HTTP client authentication
# set certificate           /etc/ssl/certs/certificate.crt
# set private_key           /etc/ssl/certs/key.pem

## Whether to write file lists (ALL, NEW, MD5, SHA256, SHA512 files) as apt-mirror does.
## Default - off, since apt-mirror2 doesn't use them.
# set write_file_lists        off

## Enable Prometheus client
# set prometheus_enable   off
# set prometheus_host     localhost
# set prometheus_port     8000

## Retries
## How much times retry to download broken release files
# set release_files_retries 15

## Run script after mirror complete
# set run_postmirror    0
## Path to Post Mirror script
# All configuration variables are available in `postmirror_script` uppercased
# with prefix `APT_MIRROR_`, eg `${APT_MIRROR_BASE_PATH}`
# set postmirror_script $var_path/postmirror.sh

## By default redundant files are not removed after mirror update.
## Shell script is created in the path specified by `cleanscript` option
## that can be used to clean mirror.
# set cleanscript     $var_path/clean.sh

## If `_autoclean` option is specified and enabled, clean script will
## not be created and mirror will be cleaned
# set _autoclean 0
## To protect repositories against erroneous wiping do not perform repository cleanup
## when more than `repository_size * wipe_size_ratio` total size to be cleaned or
## more than `repository_files_count * wipe_count_ratio` total files to be removed.
## Use 0 to disable wipe protection.
# set wipe_size_ratio 0.4
# set wipe_count_ratio 0.4


## Mirrors are configured using standard sources.list syntax
## Binary mirrors
# deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Or via `deb-arch`
# deb-amd64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-arm64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Although not supported by sources.list it's possible to specify codenames or directories
## separated by commas without spaces here.
# deb-amd64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic,jammy main restricted universe multiverse
# deb https://packages.ntop.org/apt-stable/20.04/ x64/,all/

## `by-hash` option can be used to control mirroring using hashsums paths.
## A `yes` or `no` value activates/disables the use of this feature if this source indicates support for it,
## while `force` will enable the feature regardless of what the source indicates.
## Default - `yes`.
# deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 by-hash=no ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## Source mirrors
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-security main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-updates main restricted universe multiverse
# deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic-backports main restricted universe multiverse

## Special `src` value for `arch` option can be used to specify src repository too
# deb [ arch=src ] http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic main restricted universe multiverse

## By default the name of mirrored folder constructed from mirror URL.
## Using mirror_path it's possible to override mirror folder name
# mirror_path http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu ubuntu

## Ignore errors for specified repository path.
## Can be exact file or folder.
# ignore_errors https://packages.gitlab.com/runner/gitlab-runner/debian pool/bullseye/main/g/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner_14.8.1_amd64.deb
