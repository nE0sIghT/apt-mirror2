# AI-generated and AI-assisted content

1. **AI-generated source code** (code written primarily or entirely by AI tools)
   is **forbidden** for inclusion in this project.

2. **AI-assisted source code** is allowed **only if** the contributor:
   - uses AI tools strictly as assistance (e.g. suggestions, refactoring hints)
     and remains the primary author of the code;
   - fully reviews and understands the resulting code and takes full responsibility
     for it as the author;
   - ensures that the contributed code does not include copyrighted or
     license-incompatible material.

3. AI-generated content is allowed **only for**:
   - documentation
   - test data
   - examples

4. By submitting a contribution, the contributor explicitly confirms that:
   - any included source code complies with this policy (including the prohibition
     on AI-generated source code in §1);
   - any AI-assisted code has been reviewed and is submitted under the
     contributor’s full responsibility;
   - the contribution complies with this project's license and all applicable
     copyright requirements.

5. The project maintainers reserve the right to request clarification,
   additional verification, or to reject any contribution if its provenance
   or license compliance is unclear.
